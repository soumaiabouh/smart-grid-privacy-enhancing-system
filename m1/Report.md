# Report: Analysis of Smart Meters
## Introduction
_An introduction that describes and delineates, as clearly as possible, the case/situation you targeted._

## Research Method
_A research method section that describes, precisely enough to be replicated, the procedures you have followed to collect your data._

## Results
_A results section, which provides a well-organized overview of the results you collected, with cross-references to the appendix._

- Beckel et al. (2014); fine-grained electricity consumption data, collected by smart meters, can lead to identifying specific characteristics that may reveal information about a home’s socio-economic status, dwelling and appliances with an accuracy of more than 70% for all households.  
- Monitoring electricity consumption can allow for others to make inferences about what appliances are being used, whether an individual is home or not, and even what program is being watched on TV. 
    - Appliances all have different energy usages. Reading these patterns reveals which is being used. 
    - Dennis Loehr and fellow researchers at Muenster University of Applied Sciences in Germany have demonstrated that a household electrical usage profile reveals the lighting patterns (amount of light and dark emitted on the display for individual frames); lighting patterns are unique for each TV program and movie and thus could be compared. Their results show that two 5-minute chunks of consecutive viewing without major interference of other appliances is sufficient to identify the content. 
- Onzo has stated directly that they utilize energy consumption data from smart meters to build a highly personalized profile for every energy customer. They tag the appliances being used in the home and use this virtualized profile to monetise their customer data by selling to third parties for the purpose of targeting customers with products and services relevant for that household. 


## Conclusions
_A conclusions section, which highlight the insights you can derive from the data you collected, with clear links to the evidence._

- From Beckel, we can conclude that it is possible to extract information from smart meters that consumers may prefer to keep private, including data related to income, employment status, status of relationship, or social class. 
- From Loehr, smart meters are able to become surveillance devices that monitor the behavior of customers and track personal routines 
- From Onzo, it's clear that utility companies utilizing smart meters have the capability to build generous personalized profiles of households. Homeowner data becomes more vulnerable as it is shared or traded. 

## Appendix
_An appendix, which contains larger data sets too cumbersome to put in the results section._

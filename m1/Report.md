# Report: Analysis of Smart Meters
## Introduction
_An introduction that describes and delineates, as clearly as possible, the case/situation you targeted._

- In Canada, 82% of installed meters are smart meters, with several provinces investing in research labs that focus on smart grids and their related technologies [[1](https://static4.arrow.com/-/media/arrow/files/pdf/0821/te_trend-paper-smart-metering_0521_en.pdf)].
- Smart meters do not directly manage energy distribution. Instead, they inform customers about their energy use and assist providers in optimizing energy distribution [[2](https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/articles/what-is-a-smart-grid-and-how-does-it-work)].
- Smart meters help customers save on electricity bills and enable energy providers to reduce costs by detecting leaks and outages for quicker responses. Additionally, analyzing consumption data helps in understanding customer behavior, planning better services, and making strategic decisions for future investments and emergency planning [[1](https://static4.arrow.com/-/media/arrow/files/pdf/0821/te_trend-paper-smart-metering_0521_en.pdf)].
- Traditional systems track electricity use through devices attached to meters or clamps. This data is sent wirelessly to displays or online interfaces. The smart meters adopted in the UK and several other countries improved on this with two-way wireless communication, allowing energy providers, home devices, and displays to interact. These advanced displays can keep track of energy use over time and allow data transfer to computers using USB. Online interfaces provide detailed analysis through automatic graphs and spreadsheets [[3](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5353784)].
- A home equipped with a Smart Grid system necessarily implies that it contains a smart meter that collects electricity usage data at regular intervals, such as every 30 minutes. This frequent data collection may assist in enhancing grid management for operators and enables energy suppliers to issue accurate and timely bills to their customers [[4](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8534430)].
- Onzo was formed in the early days of this policy (2015-2020 UK transition to smart meters). "The Smart Meter Implementation Program (SMIP) lays the legal framework in the United Kingdom so that a smart gas and electricity meter, along with an in-home display, can be installed in every household by 2020. Intended to reduce household energy consumption by 5–15%, the SMIP represents the world's largest and most expensive smart meter rollout. TThe SMIP will involve installing a combined 104 million pieces of new equipment when counting separate electricity and gas meters, in-home display (IHD) monitors and wireless communications networks (Lewis and Kerr, 2014). The combined total cost is expected to be at least £11 billion, or more than £200 per household (Rose and Thed, 2014)." [[1](https://static4.arrow.com/-/media/arrow/files/pdf/0821/te_trend-paper-smart-metering_0521_en.pdf)].

The transition from traditional meters to smart meters has revolutionized electricity management and energy consumption, enhancing efficiency, sustainability and convenience. Traditional analog meters are purely mechanical and measure electricity consumption by tracking the amount of electrical energy passing through them. Readings are presented on analog dials or displays, requiring a manual reading by a technician. These meters offer basic functionality and do not provide any advanced features or real-time monitoring capabilities. Conversely, a smart meter is an electrical meter, which records granular energy usage data at regular intervals, typically of 30 minutes or less. Electronic sensors and microprocessors are utilized to ensure precise measurements of energy consumption, providing more accurate billing to customers. This real-time data is wirelessly transmitted to utility companies, eliminating manual meter readings and the potential for human error in these readings. Many modern systems have adopted two-way wireless communication, allowing energy providers, home devices and displays to interact. Smart meters allow customers to monitor their own utility usage through displays or online interfaces to understand their consumption habits while additionally allowing utility companies to analyze their customer behavior to plan for better services and make strategic decisions for future investments. Canada stands as a prominent example of the widespread adoption of smart meters with 82% of installed meters being smart meters. Several provinces have made substantial investments in research labs that focus on smart grids and their related technologies. 

While these devices offer unprecedented insights into energy consumption patterns, their integration into daily lives raises important questions about data security, personal privacy, and the ethical use of consumer information. It is imperative to acknowledge the multifaceted impact of smart meters, specifically regarding the capabilities of parties with access to customer smart meter data to track personal routines, identify household properties, and curate personalized profiles.

## Results
_A results section, which provides a well-organized overview of the results you collected, with cross-references to the appendix._

Smart meters not only gauge the overall energy usage of a household but also serve as a gateway to more nuanced insights, specifically with the case of energy disaggregation where usage and energy consumption at the device level is extracted [1]. This is possible because each appliance has a distinctive load signature, representing its power consumption characteristics over time. The two distinct approaches for monitoring energy usage and energy disaggregation are intrusive load monitoring (ILM) and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). ILM involves connecting power meters to each appliance in the household, providing accurate results although with high costs and complex installation, thus referred to as intrusive [2]. In NILM, analysis of the changes in voltage and current of the aggregate load are used to deduce the state of operation of individual appliances. The aggregated signal is split into device signals using source separation methods or machine learning-based models to detect the existence of devices. 
- Energy disaggregation can be formulated as a source separation problem where the aggregated signal is expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors in a matrix factorization framework. This method is referred to as Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). 
- Variants of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) have been adopted to model the state transition patterns of appliances and to recognize the logical switch on and off and different appliances. [2] 



- Beckel et al. (2014); fine-grained electricity consumption data, collected by smart meters, can lead to identifying specific characteristics that may reveal information about a home’s socio-economic status, dwelling and appliances with an accuracy of more than 70% for all households.  
- Monitoring electricity consumption can allow for others to make inferences about what appliances are being used, whether an individual is home or not, and even what program is being watched on TV. 
    - Appliances all have different energy usages. Reading these patterns reveals which is being used. 
    - Dennis Loehr and fellow researchers at Muenster University of Applied Sciences in Germany have demonstrated that a household electrical usage profile reveals the lighting patterns (amount of light and dark emitted on the display for individual frames); lighting patterns are unique for each TV program and movie and thus could be compared. Their results show that two 5-minute chunks of consecutive viewing without major interference of other appliances is sufficient to identify the content. 
- Onzo has stated directly that they utilize energy consumption data from smart meters to build a highly personalized profile for every energy customer. They tag the appliances being used in the home and use this virtualized profile to monetise their customer data by selling to third parties for the purpose of targeting customers with products and services relevant for that household. 
- Smart meters face risks like cyber-attacks, tampering, and data privacy issues. Both manufacturers and utility companies are normally responsible for protecting these meters and the data they send. To secure the meters and data, they may need to use strong communication rules, control who can access the system, and encrypt data whether it is stored or being sent. On the manufacturing side, security measures may include setting up device keys, security certificates, and specific settings to ensure the information is secure and trustworthy [[1](https://static4.arrow.com/-/media/arrow/files/pdf/0821/te_trend-paper-smart-metering_0521_en.pdf)].
- As a paper published in 2018 by Cleemput et al. demonstrated, it is possible that an attacker can completely remove the anonymity from users’ detailed metering data by employing a straightforward matching algorithm. The researchers examined whether a supplier could extract additional insights from collected electricity usage data. A supplier would normally have in their possession the SM IDs of the customers along with the detailed records of electricity consumed every half hour, which lacks personal identifiers. From the latter, it is trivial to calculate the aggregated monthly data that sums up total consumption per customer. The de-pseudonymization method involves analyzing customers' unique monthly aggregate consumption data, starting with the earliest month available. If a customer's monthly aggregate is unique, their detailed half-hourly data for that month directly identifies them. This process is repeated monthly, focusing on users not yet de-pseudonymized, progressively identifying individuals based on their consumption patterns [[4](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8534430)].


## Conclusions
_A conclusions section, which highlight the insights you can derive from the data you collected, with clear links to the evidence._

- From Beckel, we can conclude that it is possible to extract information from smart meters that consumers may prefer to keep private, including data related to income, employment status, status of relationship, or social class. 
- From Loehr, smart meters are able to become surveillance devices that monitor the behavior of customers and track personal routines 
- From Onzo, it's clear that utility companies utilizing smart meters have the capability to build generous personalized profiles of households. Homeowner data becomes more vulnerable as it is shared or traded. 
- The design of the smart meters as they are offered presently makes it very easy to abuse customer data. The devices collect detailed usage information that could potentially reveal personal habits and routines based on energy consumption patterns. Since the data is transmitted wirelessly, there is a risk of interception or unauthorized access if proper encryption and security protocols are not in place. Additionally, the two-way communication capability, while advantageous for remote management and real-time data access, also increases the potential vectors for cyber attacks.
- The meters' ability to communicate with other home devices and the provider's network means that multiple points in the system could be exploited to access consumer data. Furthermore, without strict data protection policies and transparency from companies like Onzo, there is a concern that this data could be shared with third parties without explicit consent from consumers.
- Moreover, the web-based interfaces and advanced display units that allow users to track their energy consumption history are potential targets for hackers. If these systems are compromised, detailed user data could be accessed, including times when the home is unoccupied or patterns of usage that could be sensitive.
- The study by Cleemput et al. investigated the possibility of identifying individual users by analyzing their unique patterns of electricity usage. Although it is true that the data does not contain names, the distinctiveness of a user's electricity consumption pattern could allow for identification. This is especially true if additional information, such as a list of customers, becomes available to an external party, enabling them to link anonymous data to specific individuals, hence underlining the importance of protecting this sensitive information. Enhanced security measures and strict privacy protocols are therefore essential to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that individuals' consumption data remains confidential. The findings underscore the need for robust data protection strategies within smart metering systems to safeguard against potential privacy breaches.

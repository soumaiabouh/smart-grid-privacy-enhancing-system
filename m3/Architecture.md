## 1. System Purpose and Scope
*Determine the main function of the system and its functional boundaries. For example, is this a podcast listener? An information website? An image sharing tool? Clarify any potential ambiguity about the extent of the functionality it would cover. Identify the main privacy requirements. You are encouraged to stick to the core functionality. Be careful of [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep), and of including requirements that would be difficult or impossible to prototype in a demonstration application (e.g., automotive software).*

## 2. Similar Systems
*To help in your requirement elicitation, make sure to consider the state of the art in terms of systems in the same class. Presumably these would be systems that are _not_ implemented following the principles of Privacy by Design. Envision this section as a kind of comparison between your future system and the existing "competition" (see [the Threema docs](https://threema.ch/en/messenger-comparison) for an example of what this can look like).*

## 3. Functional Requirements
*List, using a structured format (e.g., enumerated lists organized by section) the main functional requirements your system will support. Include in this list any required system or user interface requirements.*

## 4. Privacy Requirements
*List, using a structured format (e.g., enumerated lists organized by section) the main privacy requirements your system will support.*

> For reference, the following activities are described in detail in [Rozanski and Woods Ch. 13](https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/794554030).

## 5. Stakeholders
*Clarify who would be using you system, especially if there are different classes of users.*

## 6. Architectural Design Decisions and Models:
*Elicit a high-level decomposition of your system into components, modes of communication, major technology used, etc. Be sure to represent decisions that have an impact on privacy. Create one or more original diagrams representing the key aspects of the system. UML is strongly recommended. Ad hoc boxologies are not recommended. The model should be consistent with the decisions elicited.*

## 7. Important Scenarios:
*Identify and describe important scenarios. A scenario is "a well-defined description of an interaction between an external entity and the system. It defines the event that triggers the scenario, the interaction initiated by the external entity, and the response required of the system" [Rozanski and Woods]. You can represent scenarios using plain text or UML Sequence Diagrams. The scenarios you choose should be relevant to the privacy requirements and be generally useful for developing and communicating your system architecture.*
